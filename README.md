# Marshall's List Maker

## Overview
As someone who constantly makes lists—whether it's a to-do list, grocery list, or trip checklist—I wanted to build a web application for this purpose. The end result is a classic CRUD application for making checklists built with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> that allows users to sort and filter their lists based on desired criteria. 

## Challenges
The greatest challenge I faced while building my first React project was learning how to properly update state variables using hooks. At times I struggled to understand why certain components were not re-rendering when I expected them to, but I learned a lot and gained confidence as I progressed through the project.
